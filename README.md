New York City, often called "The City That Never Sleeps," is the largest and one of the most influential cities in the United States. Comprising five boroughs—Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, Staten Island, and The Bronx—each borough functions like a small city within the larger metropolis. Surrounded by water and within sight of the ocean, NYC is a vital commercial center and has long been regarded as a land of opportunity.

The city has attracted researchers for its unique psycho-social aspects, such as poor sleep quality among adolescents and the health behaviors of overweight taxi drivers. NYC has also been a hub for social innovation, including the use of electronic health records for chronic conditions and the testing of autonomous taxis.

Despite extensive research, much remains to be uncovered about the "Big Apple." In the age of big data, NYC offers opportunities to explore the mysteries of urban life and the human condition. The 311 Service Requests dataset, one of the most popular publicly available datasets in NYC, has garnered significant research interest. This work aims to describe the 311 dataset, conduct an exploratory data analysis, and assess the quality of the information for future studies.
